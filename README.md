# üéì CodeTutor AI

**CodeTutor AI is an interactive web application designed to help users learn programming concepts by leveraging the power of Google Gemini AI.**

It offers a dynamic learning experience where users can upload their code files, paste code directly, or type in a programming concept they wish to understand. The AI provides explanations, runnable code examples of varying difficulty (which can be changed on the fly), practice questions, tools for deeper exploration ("More Explanation", "Ask AI Follow-up"), and constructive feedback on user solutions.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

*   **Node.js**: Version 18.x or later (includes npm). Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
*   **Git**: For cloning the repository (if applicable). Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
*   **Google Gemini API Key**: Obtain this from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey). This is crucial for the AI features to work.

## üöÄ Getting Started & Local Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run CodeTutor AI locally using **Vite**.

**1. Obtain Project Files**

   Clone the repository (if available) or download/create the project files. Ensure you have `index.html`, `vite.config.ts`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.node.json`, and the `src` directory in your project root.
   ```bash
   # If cloning:
   # git clone <your-repository-url>
   # cd <project-directory-name>
   ```

**2. Install Dependencies**

   Open your terminal in the project's root directory and run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This will install all dependencies listed in `package.json` (React, Gemini SDK, Vite, etc.) into a `node_modules` folder.

**3. Configure API Key (Critical!)**

   The AI functionalities depend on your Google Gemini API Key.

   *   **Create `.env` File**: In the **root directory** of your project (same level as `package.json`), create a file named exactly `.env`.
   *   **Add API Key**: Open `.env` and add your key:
       ```env
       API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_GOES_HERE"
       ```
       Replace `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_GOES_HERE` with your actual key.
   *   **Git Ignore**: Ensure `.env` is listed in your `.gitignore` file (a provided `.gitignore` file should already include this). This prevents your API key from being committed to version control.

   > **Note**: The `vite.config.ts` (provided) is set up to load this `API_KEY`. If the development server is running, **restart it** after creating or modifying the `.env` file for the key to be recognized.

**4. Check `index.html`**

   Ensure your `index.html` file (in the project root) **does not contain a `<script type="importmap">...</script>` block.** Vite handles module resolution from `node_modules` when you use `npm install`. The importmap is for CDN-based module loading without a build step and will conflict with Vite.
   The script tag loading your application should be:
   ```html
   <script type="module" src="/src/index.tsx"></script>
   ```

**5. (Review) Project Configuration Files**
   The project should include:
   *   `package.json`: Manages dependencies and scripts (e.g., `npm run dev`).
   *   `vite.config.ts`: Configures the Vite build tool, including how `process.env.API_KEY` is handled.
   *   `tsconfig.json` & `tsconfig.node.json`: TypeScript compiler configurations.
   *   `src/env.d.ts`: Provides TypeScript definitions for environment variables like `process.env.API_KEY`.

## üñ•Ô∏è Running the Application Locally

Once setup is complete:

1.  **Start the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
2.  **Open in browser**: Vite will typically output a local URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`). Open this URL in your web browser.

## üìÅ Project Structure

The project follows a typical React/TypeScript structure, organized within the `src` directory:

```
<project-root>/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public/                # Static assets (if any, Vite serves index.html from root)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/        # Reusable UI components
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/             # Custom React hooks (useGlobalSettings, useTheme - if used)

‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/          # AI service integration (geminiService.ts)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles/            # Global styles (theme.css - minimal, Tailwind handles most)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types.ts           # Core TypeScript type definitions and enums
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.tsx            # Main application component (routing, global state management)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.tsx          # React DOM entry point (mounts App to root)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ env.d.ts           # TypeScript declarations for environment variables
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env                   # Environment variables (API_KEY) - **DO NOT COMMIT**
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore             # Files and folders ignored by Git
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html             # Main HTML entry point for the browser

## üîç Troubleshooting

*   **API Key Errors**:
    *   *"Critical Setup Error: The API_KEY environment variable is missing..."*
    *   *"Action Required: The API_KEY environment variable is not configured..."*
    *   *"Invalid API Key..."* / *"API key not valid..."*
    *   *"API quota exceeded..."*

    **Solutions**:
    1.  Ensure `.env` is in the **project root** (not `src/`) and named correctly.
    2.  Verify `API_KEY="YOUR_KEY"` is correctly set in `.env`.
    3.  Confirm your `vite.config.ts` correctly defines `process.env.API_KEY`.
    4.  Check your Google AI Studio dashboard for key validity and quota status.
    5.  **Always restart your development server (`npm run dev`)** after changes to `.env` or `vite.config.ts`.

*   **"Failed to resolve import..." (e.g., for `react`, `@google/genai`)**:
    *   This usually means the package is not installed correctly in `node_modules` or `npm install` was missed.
    *   **Solution**: Stop the dev server. Run `npm install`. Then restart the dev server (`npm run dev`).

*   **"Script error." (often a blank page or console error with no details)**:
    *   This can be caused by a conflict if an `<script type="importmap">` is still present in your `index.html`.
    *   **Solution**: **REMOVE the entire `<script type="importmap">` block from `index.html`**. Vite handles these dependencies when installed via npm.

*   **Type Errors / Build Failures (`npm run build`)**:
    *   Ensure all `@types/...` packages (like `@types/react`) are installed as dev dependencies (they should be in the provided `package.json`).
    *   Run `npx tsc --noEmit` from your project root in the terminal to get detailed TypeScript error messages. This command checks types without actually building.
    *   Ensure `tsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.node.json` are correctly configured.

*   **Syntax Highlighting Issues (Prism.js)**:
    *   Verify `index.html` correctly loads Prism.js CSS (`prism-okaidia.min.css`) and JavaScript files (`prism-core.min.js`, `prism-autoloader.min.js`). These are loaded via CDN.
    *   Ensure internet connectivity for Prism.js to auto-load grammars if not pre-loaded.
    *   Check browser console for Prism.js related errors.

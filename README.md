# üéì CodeTutor AI

**CodeTutor AI is an interactive web application designed to help users learn programming concepts by leveraging the power of Google Gemini AI.**

It offers a dynamic learning experience where users can upload their code files, paste code directly, or type in a programming concept they wish to understand. The AI provides in-depth analysis, runnable code examples of varying difficulty, practice questions with progressive hints, and a conversational chat for follow-up questions.

## üåü Overview

Whether you're a beginner grappling with a specific piece of code or a learner eager to master new programming paradigms, CodeTutor AI provides personalized, AI-driven assistance.

**Two Main Views:**

1.  **Dashboard**: A central hub to start a new analysis and view your activity history.
2.  **Analysis View**: An IDE-like interface with a collapsible sidebar for inputs and a main panel for detailed, interactive AI-generated results.

**Four Core Learning Modes (accessible from both views):**

1.  **üêû Debug My Code (New!)**:
    *   Submit your broken or non-working code.
    *   The AI identifies syntax and logical errors, explains them in a beginner-friendly way, and provides the corrected code with a side-by-side "diff" view to highlight the changes.
2.  **üìÅ Upload Code File**:
    *   Submit code files in a variety of languages (see "Broad Language Support" below).
    *   The AI analyzes your code to identify and explain the main programming concepts.
3.  **üìã Paste Code Directly**:
    *   Paste your code snippet into the provided editor.
    *   The AI will attempt to auto-detect the language and provide a full analysis.
4.  **‚úçÔ∏è Type a Concept**:
    *   Input any programming concept (e.g., "Python decorators," "JavaScript promises").
    *   Select the relevant programming language for contextual understanding.
    *   The AI delivers detailed explanations and illustrative examples tailored to that concept.

## üöÄ Getting Started & Local Setup

**1. Prerequisites**
*   **Node.js**: Version 18.x or later.
*   **Google Gemini API Key**: Obtain from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

**2. Installation**
```bash
npm install
```

**3. Configure API Key (Critical!)**
*   Create a `.env` file in the project's **root directory**.
*   Add your API key to it:
    ```env
    API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_GOES_HERE"
    ```
*   **Important**: If your development server is already running, **you must restart it** for the new key to take effect.

## üñ•Ô∏è Running the Application Locally

1.  **Start the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
2.  **Open in browser**: Navigate to the local URL provided by Vite (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).

## üí° How to Use the New Features

1.  **Dashboard View**:
    *   The dashboard is now your central hub. Choose an input method, provide the content, and click **"Analyze"**. This will take you to the dedicated Analysis View.
    *   You can also click on any item in your **"Recent Activity"** list to load that session directly into the Analysis View.

2.  **Analysis View**:
    *   **Collapsible Sidebar**: The left panel contains all input methods. You can collapse it by clicking the `menu_open` icon to focus on the analysis results.
    *   **Switching Inputs**: You can switch input methods (File, Concept, Paste, Debug) in the sidebar at any time to start a new analysis session.
    *   **Topic Explanation**:
        *   The explanation is now broken into collapsible sections: **Core Concepts**, **Block-by-Block**, **Line-by-Line**, and **Execution Flow**. Click any title to expand it.
        *   Below these, you'll find the **Conversational Chat** section. Type a question and hit "Send" to ask the AI for clarification.
    *   **Example Code**:
        *   Use the **Easy**, **Intermediate**, and **Hard** buttons to instantly fetch a new code example from the AI without losing your main analysis.
    *   **Practice Section**:
        *   After reviewing the question, you can now toggle between two instruction formats: **Conceptual** (high-level steps) and **Line-by-Line** (granular code construction hints).
        *   In "Conceptual" mode, if you're stuck, click the **"More Instructions"** button. The AI will provide a new, more detailed set of hints for the next level.
        *   When you're ready, write your code in the editor and click **"Check Solution"** for AI feedback.

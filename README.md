## üìã Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

*   **Node.js**: Version 18.x or later (includes npm). Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
*   **Git**: For cloning the repository. Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
*   **Google Gemini API Key**: Obtain this from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey). This is crucial for the AI features to work.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started & Local Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run CodeTutor AI locally using **Vite**.

**1. Obtain Project Files**

   Clone the repository (if available) or download the project files:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd <project-directory-name>  # e.g., codetutor-ai
   ```
   If you don't have a repository, simply create a project folder and place all provided files (`index.html`, `src/`, etc.) into it.

**2. Initialize Project & Install Dependencies**

   Open your terminal in the project's root directory.

   *   **Initialize `package.json`** (if it doesn't exist):
       ```bash
       npm init -y
       ```
   *   **Install All Dependencies**:
       The following commands install all necessary application and development dependencies.
       ```bash
       npm install react react-dom @google/genai react-hot-toast react-simple-code-editor
       npm install --save-dev vite @vitejs/plugin-react typescript @types/react @types/react-dom @types/react-simple-code-editor
       ```
       Alternatively, if your `package.json` already lists all these dependencies, you can simply run:
       ```bash
       npm install
       ```

**3. Configure Vite (`vite.config.ts`)**

   Create or update `vite.config.ts` in your project root. This file is essential for Vite's functionality and for managing environment variables like your API key.

   ```typescript
   // vite.config.ts
   import { defineConfig, loadEnv } from 'vite';
   import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

   export default defineConfig(({ mode }) => {
     // Load .env file variables from the project root
     const env = loadEnv(mode, process.cwd(), '');

     return {
       plugins: [react()],
       // Define global constants. These are statically replaced during build.
       define: {
         'process.env.API_KEY': JSON.stringify(env.API_KEY),
         // 'process.env.NODE_ENV': JSON.stringify(mode), // Optional: if you need mode in your app
       },
       // Optional: Configure server port if needed
       // server: {
       //   port: 3000, // Default is 5173
       // },
     };
   });
   ```
   > **Important**: If you modify `vite.config.ts` while the dev server is running, you'll need to restart it.

**4. Set Up `package.json` Scripts**

   Add or ensure the following scripts are in your `package.json` for convenient Vite commands:
   ```json
   // package.json
   {
     "name": "codetutor-ai", // Or your project name
     "private": true,
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "type": "module",
     "scripts": {
       "dev": "vite",                // Starts the development server
       "build": "tsc && vite build", // Type-checks and builds for production
       "preview": "vite preview"     // Locally previews the production build
     }
     // ... ensure dependencies and devDependencies from step 2 are listed here
   }
   ```

**5. Configure API Key (Critical!)**

   The AI functionalities depend on your Google Gemini API Key.

   *   **Create `.env` File**: In the **root directory** of your project (same level as `package.json`), create a file named exactly `.env`.
   *   **Add API Key**: Open `.env` and add your key:
       ```env
       API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_GOES_HERE"
       ```
       Replace `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_GOES_HERE` with your actual key.
   *   **Git Ignore**: **Crucially**, add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent your API key from being committed to version control:
       ```
       # .gitignore
       .env
       node_modules/
       dist/
       ```
   > **Note**: The `vite.config.ts` you set up in Step 3 will load this `API_KEY`. **Restart your Vite development server** after creating or modifying the `.env` file for the key to be recognized.

**6. Prepare HTML & TypeScript Definitions**

   *   **`index.html`**:
       *   Ensure it's in your project root.
       *   It should load your React app: `<script type="module" src="/src/index.tsx" defer></script>`.
       *   It includes CDN links for Tailwind CSS, Google Fonts, and Prism.js (for syntax highlighting).
       *   **CRITICAL FOR VITE/NPM SETUP**: If your `index.html` contains a `<script type="importmap">...</script>` block (which tells the browser to load modules like React from a CDN), **you MUST REMOVE IT**. When using Vite with locally installed npm dependencies (as per Step 2), Vite handles all dependency bundling from your `node_modules` folder. The importmap will conflict with Vite's module resolution and can cause errors like "Script error." or "Failed to resolve import." The Prism.js CDN links for CSS and the core/autoloader JS are generally fine to keep.

   *   **`src/env.d.ts`**:
       *   This file provides TypeScript definitions for environment variables like `process.env.API_KEY`, enabling type-safe access in your application code. Make sure it's present in the `src` directory.

## üñ•Ô∏è Running the Application Locally

Once setup is complete:

1.  **Start the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
2.  **Open in browser**: Vite will typically output a local URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`). Open this URL in your web browser.

## üîç Troubleshooting

*   **API Key Errors**:
    *   *"Critical Setup Error: The API_KEY environment variable is missing..."*
    *   *"Action Required: The API_KEY environment variable is not configured..."*
    *   *"Invalid API Key..."* / *"API key not valid..."*
    *   *"API quota exceeded..."*

    **Solutions**:
    1.  Ensure `.env` is in the **project root** (not `src/`) and named correctly.
    2.  Verify `API_KEY="YOUR_KEY"` is correctly set in `.env`.
    3.  Confirm your `vite.config.ts` correctly defines `process.env.API_KEY`.
    4.  Check your Google AI Studio dashboard for key validity and quota status.
    5.  **Always restart your development server (`npm run dev`)** after changes to `.env` or `vite.config.ts`.

*   **"Failed to resolve import..." (e.g., for `react-simple-code-editor`, `react`, `@google/genai`)**:
    *   This usually means the package is not installed correctly in `node_modules`.
    *   **Solution**: Stop the dev server. Run `npm install` (or the specific `npm install <package-name>` command from Step 2 of setup). Then restart the dev server.

*   **"Script error." (often a blank page or console error with no details)**:
    *   This is frequently caused by a conflict between Vite's bundling and an existing `<script type="importmap">` in your `index.html`.
    *   **Solution**: As per Step 6 of setup, **REMOVE the entire `<script type="importmap">` block from `index.html`**. Vite will handle these dependencies.

*   **Type Errors / Build Failures (`npm run build`)**:
    *   Ensure all `@types/...` packages (like `@types/react`, `@types/react-simple-code-editor`) are installed as dev dependencies.
    *   Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to get detailed TypeScript error messages.

*   **Syntax Highlighting Issues**:
    *   Verify `index.html` correctly loads Prism.js CSS (`prism-okaidia.min.css`) and JavaScript files (`prism-core.min.js`, preloaded languages, `prism-autoloader.min.js`).
    *   Ensure internet connectivity for Prism.js to auto-load grammars if not pre-loaded.
    *   Check browser console for Prism.js related errors.
